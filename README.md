# SpecialFittApp - CoreData

I learned how to use CoreData in this Project.
With this special fitness application, you will be able to build fitness and cooking programs completely for yourself, free of charge. The feature that distinguishes the application from others is that it is simple and completely original. In addition, since the creator of the application is also interested in fitness, he will continue the development process actively. (in development)
